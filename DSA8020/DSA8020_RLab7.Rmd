The dataset \texttt{PlantGrowth} contains results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions.

*Data Source:* Dobson, A. J. (1983) *An Introduction to Statistical Modelling*. London: Chapman and Hall.

Let's load the data first:

**Code:**

```{r}
data(PlantGrowth)
str(PlantGrowth)
```

1. Compute the treatment means and standard deviations 

**Code:**

```{r}

```

2. Make side-by-side boxplots by treatment 

**Code:**

```{r}

```

3. Write down the effets model, explain each term in the model (including the model assumptions regarding the random error)

**Answer:**

4. Perform an overall F-test using ANOVA, state the hypotheses, p-value, decision, and
conclusion 

**Code:**

```{r}

```

**Answer:**



5. Conduct pairwise comparisons using Tukey's HSD  procedure

**Code:**

```{r}

```

**Answer:**

6. Use qqplot to examine the normality assumption on error 

**Code:**

```{r}

```

**Answer:**

7. Make a residual plot to assess equal variance assmuption

**Code:**

```{r}

```

**Answer:**

8. Perform a Leveneâ€™s test for equal variance

**Code:**

```{r}

```
